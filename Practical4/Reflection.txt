I think this Practical is difficult. At the very beginning, I don't know how to install git in cygwin terminal. I did the Git part slowly but I think it's not a big deal after I am more skilled. Besides, I think in task 4 Making a website with Github pages, the correct command to push the changes to Github is "git push origin main", but not the previous "git push origin master". This Practical is really hard when I first used Git and Github, but later, after I understood the meaning of commands like "add" or "commit" or "push", I found it much easier than before.
